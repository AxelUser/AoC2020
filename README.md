# AoC2020

[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions by SKB Kontur's developers

All code is written in TypeScript, targeting Node v14 or later

Puzzle solutions are located in the `src` directory, separated by day and part

To run a specific puzzle:

- [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node v14 or later
- Run `npm i` in the root directory
- Run `npm start -- src/day-01/part1.ts` or specify a different day and part
- Have fun!

Note: some puzzles require user-specific input, it's either read from stdin, or hard-coded in the solution. Check the solution you're about to run to find out more
